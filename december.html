                I talked to my content expert through a zoom meeting and showed him progress in my app. I asked him for some suggestions and improvements that I could make in my app and what are the next steps I should take. One of the suggestions he gave me was to organize my Jupyter Notebook (an app I am using to write code) so that I can use it as a second portfolio. I need to add comments and notes in the code so that it is easier for other people looking at the code to understand each and every line.
