                I created correlation graphs to analyze crash data provided in a CSV file from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) website. Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, I loaded and cleaned the data with pandas, ensuring that all relevant columns were formatted correctly for analysis. I then calculated correlation values between various factors like weather conditions, time of day, and crash severity to understand how these factors might influence each other. To visualize these relationships, I used the seaborn and matplotlib libraries to generate heatmaps and scatter plots. These graphs made it easier to identify patterns and outliers in the crash data, providing insights into the factors that are most strongly correlated with accident frequency and severity.

                I also submitted my app which I made to the Congressional App Challenge. This app is basically a strong prototype, which I will improve in this independent study project which displays a map, and on that map there are crash zones (the areas that have the most frequent amount of crashes on Virginia, which I analyzed from the crash data file), and if the users current location is in one of these crash zones, then they will be notified to be careful while driving.
